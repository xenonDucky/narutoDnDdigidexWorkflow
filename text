## A Few Things to Note
The following stat blocks are meant to be used with the ***Digimon Tamer*** (WIP) class but may be used as standard adversaries. Below are unique rulings that will only be applicable if using them in the context for the ***Digimon Tamer*** class. If you are using these stat blocks for standard adversaries, most of the notes on this page will not apply to you.

### Proficiency
Whenever Proficiency is mentioned on the stat block, replace it with the Tamer's Proficiency.

### Classification
There are four **Attribute Classifications** that take the place of the *Adversary Clan/Species*. These are *Free*, *Virus*, *Vaccine* and *Data*. These **Attribute Classifications** may interact with features, seals or effects.        

Additionally, each Digimon belongs to a particular *Type* and/or *Family*. These interact with certain ***Digimon Tamer*** class features and dictate some Digivolution restrictions.

### Jutsu Components and Keywords
If a Digimon would cast a jutsu that would consume a weapon or the charge of a kit, they ignore this component. 
:
Generally, Digimon will have access to, at maximum, two nature releases without having a special trait. 
:
**Optional Rule:** Digimon replace the **HS** component with the **M** component. This can be used to make the spellcasting feel more authentic to Digimon.

### Jutsu Casting Modifiers
Unless otherwise noted via a feature/trait that the Digimon possesses, Digimon use the following Ability Scores for Justu attack and DC calculations. They will always use the higher Ability Score if two Ability Scores are listed. 
- Ninjutsu = Intelligence
- Genjutsu = Wisdom or Charisma
- Taijutsu and Bukijutsu = Strength or Dexterity.       

### Alternative Jutsu List
Each Digimon has a unique set list of jutsu assigned to it. However, if these jutsu do not suit the adversary you are building or the partner you are creating, feel free to use the alternative jutsu casting list. 

This list enables users to choose a number of jutsu from a list of set requirements - similar to that of base game summons.

## Gazimon
Gazimon is a Digimon with large, sharp claws. It is bipedal, which is rare amongst Mammal types; the claws on its forelegs likely evolved to allow its forelegs to be used as arms, therefore resulting in its bipedalism. It has an extremely aggressive temperament despite its small size, and it never warms up to humans. Although the claws on its forelegs are very effective at attacking, they are also surprisingly suited to digging holes, which it always does as it enjoys watching other Digimon fall into its pitfalls due to its mischievous personality.

## ShellNumemon
A Crustacean Digimon, it was a Numemon that made use of its intelligence and found a shell to cover itself in order to protect its body. As a result, while it is slightly more intelligent than Numemon, it in turn grew a cowardly personality, and will retreat into its shell in shock at even the slightest disturbance. Its defense is extremely high while it is holed up in its shell, remaining firm even when it is kicked or stepped on.
## Scaling Enemy
ShellNumemon ranges between levels 5-8. To upscale a ShellNumemon perform the following steps at each level.

- **Level 6+,** Increase the ShellNumemon's Hit Points by 12 & Chakra Points by 7 for every level.
- **Level 7.** The ShellNumemon's Proficiency (Prof) bonus increases by +1. This increases their Skills, Proficient Saving Throws, Save DC's, AC and to hit bonuses by +1.

A Holy Beast Digimon that is protected by a mystical force. Its tail has a will of its own and, at will, can become an enlarged blade.

Many fools have dropped their guard around a Reppamon, and many fools have lost their life to this swift Digimon.

## Shellmon
Although it has a turtle-like appearance when settled inside its shell, it actually has a soft body like that of a mollusk. Because its body rapidly gets bigger as it grows, it switches homes each time until it reaches the size of a small mountain. Not only that, it has a habit of settling into anything it is able to fit its body into. Since it has low intelligence and a belligerent personality, one must take caution when coming across a Shellmon. 
## Scaling Enemy

## Creating My Own Digimon (WIP)

### General Rules For Creation
All Digimon listed in this compendium (with few exceptions) are built around the following guidelines:
{{classTable,frame
##### Digimon Guidelines
| Digimon Stage|Level Range| Stat Total |AC Bonus|Hit & Damage Bonus| HP Bonus Per Level|Max Jutsu| N
|:------------:|:--------:|:---------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:------:|
|  Rookie      |   1-4    |    72     |    —    |    —    |    —    |    D    |    1   |
|  Champion    |   5-8    |    80     |    1    |    1    |    —    |    C    |    2   |
|  Ultimate    |   9-12   |    88     |    2    |    2    |    1    |    B    |    3   |
|  Mega        |   13-16  |    96     |    3    |    3    |    2    |    A    |    4   |
|  Perfect     |   17-20  |    104    |    4    |    4    |    3    |    S    |    5   |
}}

Additionally, each stage has a general maximum individual stat cap, as listed below:

| Digimon Stage     | Maximum Stat Total |
|:------------------|:------------------:|
| Rookie            |  18                |
| Champion          |  20                |
| Ultimate          |  22                | 
| Mega              |  24                | 
| Perfect           |  26                |       
                                  
Also, movement speed is tied to Digimon Stage. Most Digimon will only use the Base Walking Speed calculation for their Movement Speed. However, if a creature has an alternative movement form (Burrowing, Flying, Swiming), they will have an Alternative Walking Speed.  Some traits can circumvent these but below are the general rules for movement speed calculation:
{{classTable,frame
##### Digimon Movement Speed
| Digimon Stage |Base Walking Speed|Alternative Movement Form |Alternative Walking Speed |
|:-------------:|:----------------:|:-----------------------:|:-------------------:|
|  Rookie       |       30ft.      |           20ft.         |         15ft.       |   
|  Champion     |       35ft.      |           30ft.         |         25ft.       |  
|  Ultimate     |       40ft.      |           35ft.         |         30ft.       |   
|  Mega         |       40ft.      |           35ft.         |         35ft.       | 
|  Perfect      |       45ft.      |           40ft.         |         40ft.       | 
}}

\column
### Digimon Damage Calculation
Digimon have their basic weapon damage die determined by their Stage. Some features may influence or change this. The chart below demonstrates the basic guidelines for weapon damage die. 

It is designed around allowing single attack Digimon to have similar output to multiattack Digimon.  However, these are some important things to keep in mind.
- If the Digimon has access to the *Multiattack* function and does not have a unique property or effect, it uses the ***Multiattack Damage Die*** category.
- If the Digimon makes a single attack for the *Attack* action that does not have a unique property or effect, they use the ***Single Attack*** category.
- If the weapon attack itself has a unique property or effect (such as *Grapple* or increased range), lower its damage die by one stage.

{{classTable,frame
##### Digimon Weapon Damage
| Digimon Stage |Attacks Per Action| Muliattack Damage Die |Single Attack|
|:-------------:|:----------------:|:---------------------:|:-----------:|
|  Rookie       |         1        |            —          |    1d8      |
|  Champion     |         2        |           1d8         |    2d12     |
|  Ultimate     |         2        |           1d10        |    3d10     |
|  Mega         |         3        |           1d10        |    5d10     |
|  Perfect      |         3        |           1d12        |    6d12     |
}}




### AC Calculation
Unless noted via special features or otherwise, the calculation for all adversaries is: 

AC = 10 + Proficiency + Dexterity Modifier.


### Health and Chakra Calculation
Digimon, unlike other adversaries, follow the character creation Health and Chakra Guidelines. This is to ensure that they are balanced for the ***Digimon Tamer*** class. 

As such, on level up, they gain Health Points equal to the maximum of their Health Die + Consitution Modifier. However, only gain the average of their Chakra Die + Constitution Modifier.

### Traits
Each trait listed within this document has a certain rank assigned to it. Digimon can only gain a rank that would be equal to or lower than their Max Jutsu Rank. 

It is important to note that due to the complexity of consistently controlling and designing essentially two characters, most traits are rather passive in their approach. This is a design choice to ensure that things are not too complicated for Players. When designing a Digimon, try to avoid having too many features that are 'active' in their nature.

Additionally, Digimon have a limit on how many traits that they can possess based on their Stage. Follow the chart below:
